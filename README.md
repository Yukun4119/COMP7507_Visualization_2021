### Objectives

1. Present the relationship between the data related to traffic accidents via modern visualization technologies.

2. Extract spatiotemporal patterns of traffic accidents.

3. Analyze the features of traffic accidents, and give several practical suggestions for the government to take effective measures in advance to avoid some accidents.

### Methodology

* **Tableau**

  Tableau Desktop can help us quickly build figures and uncover unanticipated insights.  It is a powerful tool to achieve live data analytics and build interactive dashboards.

* **Third-party packages in Python**

  Python is a simple yet powerful development language. With the help of its rich third-party packages (e.g.,  numpy, pandas, matplotlib and so on), we could wrangle and analyze our data efficiently.

* **React**

  The most popular front-end framework. We will use it to assemble our figures together and present them clearly. React is an ideal framework to present our visualization work.

* **Ant Design**

  Ant Design provides a set of high-quality React components out of the box. It will help make our presentations more varied. 

  We decide to use React & Ant Design to give a demonstration of our project.

* **ArcGIS**

   A powerful geospatial data analysis and presentation tool.
