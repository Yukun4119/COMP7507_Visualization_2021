### Project objectives: 

Present the relationship between the data related to traffic accidents via modern visualization technologies.

Extract spatiotemporal pattern of traffic accidents.

Analyse the feature of traffic accidents and suggest ways to avoid some of the accidents in advance. Also, it can help the government make better traffic regulations. 

### Methodology:

* Tableau: Tableau Desktop can help us quickly build figures and uncover unanticipated insights.  It is a powerful tool to achieve live data analytics and build interactive dashboards.
* Third-party packages in Python: Python is a simple yet powerful development language. With the help of its rich third-party packages, we will build the figures we want.
* React: The most popular front-end framework. We will use it to assemble our figures together and present them clearly.
* Ant Design: Ant Design provides a set of high-quality React components out of the box. It will help make our presentations more varied.
* Arcgis: A powerful geospatial data analysis and presentation tool.
